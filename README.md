# csv2chart_app
Wikipedia and Wikiversity have templates for creating a graphs/diagram based on data. The benefit of data driven dynamic graphs is that the mathematical curves can be updated much easier. The concept of this repository was developed during COVID-19. Considering this example the number of cases is updated on a daily basis. Updating the image in WikiCommons on a daily basis is consuming much more space for versioning and an update justs adds one additional (x,y) value pair to the chart. The development of this AppLSAC is part of a Wikiveristy learning resource about AppLSAC WebApps https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/AppLSAC/JSON2Schema and it is build on the JSON Editor of Jeremy Dorn.
